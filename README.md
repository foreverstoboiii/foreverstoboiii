### Who am I, if I still don’t know what I’m trying to become?

I build, break, and rebuild — not for show, but to understand.  
No promises of genius. Just consistent doubt and curiosity.  
Sometimes I code. Sometimes I vanish. But I’m always observing.

 — and yet, here I am... typing, testing, thinking. Why?

What does it mean to create something no one sees?  
Does it make it less real?

I don’t need applause.  
I need silence loud enough to hear what’s next.
